# machine_learning_basics

This is a collection of my Jyputer scrapbooks I created during Machine Learning course -> as a simple notetaking. 

If anyone stumbles on to this, hoping its helpful. 

### The first notebook posted here is my practice on implementing logistic regression using Pima-Indian-Diabetes dataset. I obtained that dataset from url="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/npradaschnor/Pima-Indians-Diabetes-Dataset/master/diabetes.csv".
